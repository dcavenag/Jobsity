# Jobsity

On a terminal and clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/dcavenag/Jobsity.git`

Ensure you have NPM installed first

Go to the cloned folder and install cypress using npm `npm install cypress --save-dev`

Once installed, install the dependencies running `npm i -d`

Once installed you can run the whole test suite using this command `npm run cypress:run`

This will create a new run that you can access here https://dashboard.cypress.io/projects/eoq7ig/runs

Once the test are executed you can open the last run and check the results
